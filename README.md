# Airport Locker Rental

## About
A console application involving the management of locker rentals
and item storage. This application demonstrates the use of some basic C#
concepts.

## Key Features
- An interactive UI
- Locker management methods such as: renting, returning, viewing, and listing lockers
- A demonstration of data types, variables, conditional branching, loops, and arrays
- A example of separation of concerns and the single resposibility principle by means of classes

Simply copy the repository to your local machine and open the solution with a compatible IDE.
Visual Studio 2022 was used in building this application, so I recommend using that.
